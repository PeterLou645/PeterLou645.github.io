      <p>Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's being born
      Same time my man is murdered, the beginning and end
      As far as rap go, it's only natural, I explain
      My plateau, and also, what defines my name
      First it was Nasty, but times have changed
      Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my science for pain
      I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame
      Saw fiends shoot up, and do lines of cocaine
      Saw my close friends shot, flat-line am I sane?
      That depends, carry Mac-10's to practice my aim
      On rooftops, tape CD covers to trees
      Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
      Street scriptures for lost souls, in the crossroads
      To the corner thugs hustling for cars that cost dough
      To the big dogs living large, taking it light
      Pushing big</p>
