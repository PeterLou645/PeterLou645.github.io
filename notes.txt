basic html syntax
close and open a paragraph
<p> and then close </p> p is for paragraph tag
<h> is for heading and you close use the / symble tag just like p
<em> is for emphasis tag
tag location is very important!!

****************************************

Html Structure
Broad:
Like a sandwich: two bread is need it, so you need a open and close html tag.
first thing you need a doctype telling what type of html you are using
then your html tag (html lang="en"), you close it with </html>
<b>= bolded

Detail:
doctype: the first thing to write in your html file. is tells the system what type of html you are using( the one we need rightnow is htmls)
head: place informaiont reference styles and other info about the htmls
charset: setting what type of lanuage characters do you use
Content models: they define the type of content expected inside an element and control syntax rules such as element nesting.

4.Functions and objects
Functions : mini program in side our javascripts
Ex: Function multiply(a,b){
    var result = a*b;
    console.log(result);
    return result;
}
var multiply = multiply(3,4)
It can either create a result immediately or provide answer or output
3 functions:
Named Functions: function to call when we need it and just pass reference into it
ex: function foo(a,b){
    methods
}
Anonymous functions: dont have name, they need to be tie to a variable
ex: var a = 7;
    var b = 8;
    var biggervar = function(){
        var result;
        a>b ? result = ["a",a]: result = ["b", b];
        console.log(result)
    }
    biggervar(); // since var have a function we can run the function by calling biggervar

immediately invoked function expressions: Runs as soon the web encounters it.
var biggervar = (function(a,b){
        var result;
        a>b ? result = ["a",a]: result = ["b", b];
        console.log(result)
    })(3,4)
    biggervar; 
    if there is define variables then the variable    
console.log is loggoing the value
ex: var x = 2;
    console.log(2); //this will show up in in console page of the web

variable scope:
    global: varible outside the function
    local: variable inside the function
    you cannot call local variable outside the function, you can with global

let and const
 cons: constant, cannot be changed once is define
 let: block scope variable, smaller scoope than var

javascripts objects

var course = new Object();

var course = {
    name = "Peter";
    age = 4;
    return name + age;
}

console.log(course)

objects constructor

function Course(title, name){
    this.title = title;
    this.name = name;
}

var course1 = new Course("c1", "name");

dot and bracket notation 
    dot ex: course.title
    bracket ex: course["title] for things liek wp:image

Closures  : a function inside a function for the inside function to work



5. JavaScript and the DOM, part 1: changing DOM Elements

DOM( document object model)
DOM is the model of the document that creat the form of webpage
